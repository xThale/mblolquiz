# Mercedes Benz League of Legends Quiz Solver

During the League of Legends World Championship a Mercedes Benz Quiz was available every 30 minutes. The top 50 competitors reached time-based scores which were humanly not possible. As a challenge I created a simple application which can control a web browser and answer the questions within nanoseconds. Since an answer time below a certain threshold results in an unsuccessful answer, a delay has to be implemented. The top 50 competitors were simply tasked to find the shortest, still valid delay to take the first place. After testing the application, I found this delay and managed to get the first place. To not destroy the integrity of the quiz (which was non-existent in the first place), I deemed my challenge as successful and uploaded the software to GitHub as a backup.
